# SongScout
CS554 Final Project

Our project allows users to have more customizable recommendation options than the regular Spotify website. Find songs using the audio features that aren't usually available on Spotify search options. 

## Hosting the Website
To host the website, the server must be run locally, using the command "npm start". ImageMagick is hosted locally to manipulate images, which are then stored on the cloud with FireStore.
